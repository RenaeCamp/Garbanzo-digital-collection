# About {{ The Digital Legume Collection }}

This surprisingly diverse digital collection site built via metadata and Jekyll.  It is a collaboration, a "legume medley" of objects from digital curation facilities on the Palouse.  The collection was created as part of the Palouse Digital Scholarship Symposium in 2018. 

### Technical

This website was created by UI Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) using the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The basic frame work is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
Metadata visualizations are created using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/).
Document metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
